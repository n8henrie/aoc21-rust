# aoc21-rust [![.github/workflows/ci.yml](https://github.com/n8henrie/aoc21-rust/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/n8henrie/aoc21-rust/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

I had a blast doing [Advent of Code 2018 in Rust][0], though I barely finished
in time for AoC 2019. After taking a couple years off, I wanted to try again
for 2021.

My goals:
1. Have fun.
2. Hopefully see how much I've improved in the last couple years.
3. Look for opportunities to practice my many weak spots and new features I've
   been hoping to try out:
    - Generics
    - Const generics
    - Declarative macros (probably not procedural)
    - Parallelism / Rayon
    - Documenting my crates
    - Workspaces
    - Async? Doubt there is much opportunity in AoC

Anything I've cared to document is at <https://n8henrie.com/aoc21-rust/aoc/>.

I'll also probably do a few problems in Go to compare the feel, since using
Rust is still a *labor* of love much of the time at my skill level and I could
probably get things done much faster in other languages (even though I'm also
very novice in Go). <https://github.com/n8henrie/aoc21-go>

I may also try a few problems in Swift. Time will tell.

## Other AoC '21 in Rust repos:

- <https://github.com/timvisee/advent-of-code-2021>
    - *Very* fast and interesting, but all the bit twiddling in the first few
      days is not very readable *to a novice like me*.
